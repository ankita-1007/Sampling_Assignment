# Sampling

Here we will perform various Sampling techniques on our Creditcard dataset. We will explore the imbalanced dataset issues and 
implementation of various techniques on different ML models. We will further analyze their accuracies and discuss the results.

## Methodolgy
### 1. Converting Imbalanced dataset to balanced dataset: <br>
   In the given dataset, the class '1' has less number of samples. We solved this issue by oversampling class '1' instances
   and making them equal to class '0' instances.
